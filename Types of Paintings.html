<p>The Mandana art form is is used for decorations, and is a tribal, and one of the most oldest painting styles to exist in India. It is drawn on the walls and floors of houses in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh (states in India) as a way to protect their home and fireplace. Mandanas are made to welcome gods and also on festive occasions. The women of the Meena community in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are the first Mandana artists. The Mandana paintings are very simple yet eye-catching. These paintings consist of cotton, twigs, a bunch of squirrel hair, and a brush made from a date stick. The base is prepared using cow dung mixed with rati (local clay), water, and red ochre. For making the motif, lime, brick, and chalk powder are used. Some basic designs of Mandana paintings are peacocks, tigers, floral, women working, Lord Ganesha, geometrical shapes, jaali, and Vedic yagna. The art form is dying and needs to find people who can keep it alive and help it regain its old popularity. This art form has later evolved, and been adapted by other parts of the world, asnd therefore the glimpse of the Mandana desings are highly visible in the famous rangolis which are designs made from powedered color during Diwali.</p>
